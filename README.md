AWE Electronics Online Store (AWE_OES) - Electronics Online Shopping Mall System


This project aimed to develop a full-featured online electronics store for AWE Electronics to expand its business from brick-and-mortar retailing throughout Australia. The system included customer account management, product catalog browsing, shopping cart functionality, order processing, a payment system, order tracking, and administrator product and sales reporting functionality.

Developed using a Software Requirements Specification (SRS), the system was designed using a task-support methodology to ensure that it met the business requirements and user expectations.

GitHub for version control and project management:
Use GitHub for code hosting, version control, and collaboration
